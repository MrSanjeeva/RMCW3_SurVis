        "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the nuanced and increasingly relevant issue of Multi-user Privacy (MP) in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). Addressing the gap in current research, we examine how LLMs can inadvertently compromise the privacy of multiple users, particularly in scenarios involving advanced multimodal capabilities. We highlight the challenges in mitigating these privacy concerns, stemming from the complexities of shared data permissions, varying user perceptions of privacy, and the dynamic nature of LLM interactions. The paper advocates for a collaborative approach, encompassing targeted research, ethical AI development, informed policy-making, and enhanced user awareness, to address these emerging privacy challenges in the realm of LLMs.",

Such a system is inherently complex, requiring models for perceptual grounding, attention, and reasoning, an intuitive interface that adapts to the performer's needs, and the orchestration of data streams from many sensors. Moreover, all data acquired by the system must be readily available for post-hoc analysis to enable developers to understand performer behavior and quickly detect failures. We introduce TIM, the first end-to-end AI-enabled task guidance system in augmented reality which is capable of detecting both the user and scene as well as providing adaptable, just-in-time feedback.

However, the design patterns and architectures to build highly capable agents or multi-agent systems are still developing, and the understanding of the implication of various design choices and algorithms is still evolving. In this paper, we present our work on building a novel web agent, Agent-E. Agent-E introduces numerous architectural improvements over prior state-of-the-art web agents such as hierarchical architecture, flexible DOM distillation and denoising method, and the concept of change observation to guide the agent towards more accurate performance. We first present the results of an evaluation of Agent-E on WebVoyager benchmark dataset and show that Agent-E beats other SOTA text and multi-modal web agents on this benchmark in most categories by 10-30%. We then synthesize our learnings from the development of Agent-E into general design principles for developing agentic systems. These include the use of domain-specific primitive skills, the importance of distillation and de-noising of environmental observations, the advantages of a hierarchical architecture, and the role of agentic self-improvement to enhance agent efficiency and efficacy as the agent gathers experience.",

        "abstract": "Despite growing enthusiasm for Multi-Agent LLM Systems (MAS), their performance gains on popular benchmarks often remain minimal compared with single-agent frameworks. This gap highlights the need to systematically analyze the challenges hindering MAS effectiveness. We present MAST (Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy), the first empirically grounded taxonomy designed to understand MAS failures. We analyze seven popular MAS frameworks across over 200 tasks, involving six expert human annotators. Through this process, we identify 14 unique failure modes, organized into 3 overarching categories, (i) specification issues, (ii) inter-agent misalignment, and (iii) task verification. MAST emerges iteratively from rigorous inter-annotator agreement studies, achieving a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.88. To support scalable evaluation, we develop a validated LLM-as-a-Judge pipeline integrated with MAST. We leverage two case studies to demonstrate MAST's practical utility in analyzing failures and guiding MAS development. Our findings reveal that identified failures require more complex solutions, highlighting a clear roadmap for future research. We open source our comprehensive dataset and LLM annotator to facilitate further development of MAS.",

        "abstract": "Multi-modal AI systems will likely become a ubiquitous presence in our everyday lives. A promising approach to making these systems more interactive is to embody them as agents within physical and virtual environments. At present, systems leverage existing foundation models as the basic building blocks for the creation of embodied agents. Embedding agents within such environments facilitates the ability of models to process and interpret visual and contextual data, which is critical for the creation of more sophisticated and context-aware AI systems. For example, a system that can perceive user actions, human behavior, environmental objects, audio expressions, and the collective sentiment of a scene can be used to inform and direct agent responses within the given environment. To accelerate research on agent-based multimodal intelligence, we define \"Agent AI\" as a class of interactive systems that can perceive visual stimuli, language inputs, and other environmentally-grounded data, and can produce meaningful embodied actions. In particular, we explore systems that aim to improve agents based on next-embodied action prediction by incorporating external knowledge, multi-sensory inputs, and human feedback. We argue that by developing agentic AI systems in grounded environments, one can also mitigate the hallucinations of large foundation models and their tendency to generate environmentally incorrect outputs. The emerging field of Agent AI subsumes the broader embodied and agentic aspects of multimodal interactions. Beyond agents acting and interacting in the physical world, we envision a future where people can easily create any virtual reality or simulated scene and interact with agents embodied within the virtual environment.",

        "abstract": "The increasing complexity of IT operations necessitates advanced automation to ensure system availability, resilience, continuity, performance, security, and maintainability. Traditional IT management frameworks, such as the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), have standardized service management processes, while models like IBM\u2019s Process Reference Model for IT (PRM-IT) have facilitated automation through structured workflows. However, critical tasks, such as incident resolution and problem management, still require significant human intervention. The adoption of development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) introduced standardized remediation playbooks, further enhancing automation. More recently, Generative AI (GenAI) has expanded automation possibilities, opening new avenues for hyper-automated IT operations. This study explored Agentic Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (Agentic AIOps), an approach that integrates AI-driven agents to autonomously manage IT operations. Our methodology features a framework for designing and developing an Agentic AIOps system that proactively detects anomalies, classifies incidents, and autonomously executes resolution workflows across infrastructure, middleware, data, and applications in complex, heterogeneous Enterprise IT environments. Our findings suggest that such a system can significantly reduce incident response time, enhance predictive maintenance, and enable self-healing IT environments. By leveraging AI agents for real-time decision making, this approach enhances operational efficiency and reduces human workload. We conclude that this Agentic AIOps system represents a transformative step toward fully autonomous IT operations.

However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition.",

MASQRAD is excellent at translating imprecise or ambiguous user inquiries into precise and actionable requests. This framework generates pertinent visualizations and responses to these focused queries, as well as thorough analyses and insightful interpretations for users. MASQRAD addresses the common shortcomings of existing solutions in domains that demand fast and precise data interpretation, such as their incapacity to successfully apply AI for generating actionable insights and their challenges with the inherent ambiguity of user queries. MASQRAD functions as a sophisticated multi-agent system but \u201cmasquerades\u201d to users as a single AI entity, which lowers errors and enhances data interaction. This approach makes use of three primary AI agents: Actor Generative AI, Critic Generative AI, and Expert Analysis Generative AI. Each is crucial for creating, enhancing, and evaluating data interactions. The Actor AI generates Python scripts to generate data visualizations from large datasets within operational constraints, and the Critic AI rigorously refines these scripts through multi-agent debate. Finally, the Expert Analysis AI contextualizes the outcomes to aid in decision-making. With an accuracy rate of 87% when handling tasks related to natural language visualization, MASQRAD establishes new benchmarks for automated data interpretation and showcases a noteworthy advancement that has the potential to revolutionize AI-driven applications.",

        "abstract": "Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) builds upon Generative AI (GenAI). It constitutes the next major step in the evolution of AI with much stronger reasoning and interaction capabilities that enable more autonomous behavior to tackle complex tasks. Since the initial release of ChatGPT (3.5), Generative AI has seen widespread adoption, giving users firsthand experience. However, the distinction between Agentic AI and GenAI remains less well understood. To address this gap, our survey is structured in two parts. In the first part, we compare GenAI and Agentic AI using existing literature, discussing their key characteristics, how Agentic AI remedies limitations of GenAI, and the major steps in GenAI\u2019s evolution toward Agentic AI. This section is intended for a broad audience, including academics in both social sciences and engineering, as well as industry professionals. It provides the necessary insights to comprehend novel applications that are possible with Agentic AI but not with GenAI. In the second part, we deep dive into novel aspects of Agentic AI, including recent developments and practical concerns such as defining agents. Finally, we discuss several challenges that could serve as a future research agenda, while cautioning against risks that can emerge when exceeding human intelligence.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous agents have long been a research focus in academic and industry communities. Previous research often focuses on training agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from human learning processes, and makes the agents hard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast amounts of Web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in human-level intelligence, leading to a surge in research on LLM-based autonomous agents. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of LLM-based autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. We first discuss the construction of LLM-based autonomous agents, proposing a unified framework that encompasses much of previous work. Then, we present a overview of the diverse applications of LLM-based autonomous agents in social science, natural science, and engineering. Finally, we delve into the evaluation strategies commonly used for LLM-based autonomous agents. Based on the previous studies, we also present several challenges and future directions in this field.",
